# Matt's Portfolio

This is the first iteration of a personal portfolio webpage for myself. As I progress in my knowledge and understanding of web development, I will be updating this website accordingly.

The primary function of this website will be to service as a way to showcase my work, for potential clients, employers, or even for friends and family.

It is currently written in two languages, HTML and CSS. The webpage currently includes media queries, so that its design can become responsive to different screen sizes.

The webpage also includes broad contact information, and a way for people to submit a message with their contact information. A future buildout of this page will add functionality to the page (submitted as an open issue in the repository, 5/18).
